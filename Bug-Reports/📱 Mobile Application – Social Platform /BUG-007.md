# BUG-007 – API returns HTTP 200 even when media upload fails

**Bug ID:** BUG-007  
**Priority:** High  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** Open  

## Description
When a media upload fails (example: unsupported file type or server validation error), the API still responds with HTTP 200. This prevents the app from showing correct error handling and leads to false success states.

## Preconditions
- User is logged in
- Postman or Network Inspector is available
- Media upload endpoint can be observed

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Attempt to upload an unsupported file type (example: .tiff) via the app or Postman
2. Inspect the upload API response (Postman or Network tab)
3. Observe status code and response body
4. Check UI behavior in the app

## Actual Result
API returns HTTP 200 while upload fails logically (error in body or upload not stored). UI may show success or stay in inconsistent state.

## Expected Result
API should return appropriate error status code (4xx) and the app should show a clear error message with retry option.

## Environment
- Tool: Postman / Chrome DevTools (remote debug)
- Device: Android Emulator
- OS: Android 13
- App Build: Staging
