# BUG-004 – Notification badge count does not match unread messages

**Bug ID:** BUG-004  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Severity:** Major  
**Status:** Open  

## Description
Unread badge count on the app icon (or in-app notifications tab) does not match the actual number of unread chat messages. This impacts reliability of unread indicators.

## Preconditions
- User is logged in
- Push notifications and in-app badges are enabled
- At least 2 chats exist

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Receive 2 new messages in different chats while app is in background
2. Open the app
3. Check unread badge count
4. Open chats and mark messages as read
5. Return to chat list/home and re-check badge count

## Actual Result
Badge count remains unchanged or shows incorrect number after messages are read.

## Expected Result
Badge count should accurately reflect unread state and update immediately after messages are opened/read.

## Environment
- Device: Android Emulator (Pixel 5)
- OS: Android 12
- App Build: Staging
- Network: Wi-Fi
