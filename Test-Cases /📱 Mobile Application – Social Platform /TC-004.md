# TC-004 – Validate unread notification badge count accuracy

**Test Case ID:** TC-004  
**Related Bug:** BUG-004  
**Test Type:** Functional / UI  
**Priority:** Medium  

## Objective
Verify that unread badge count updates correctly based on unread/read message states.

## Preconditions
- User is logged in
- Badge count feature is enabled (app icon or in-app)
- At least 2 chat conversations exist

## Test Steps
1. Put the app in background
2. Receive 2 new messages in different chats
3. Open the app and observe unread badge count
4. Open each chat and read the messages
5. Navigate back to the chat list/home screen
6. Observe badge count again

## Expected Result
- Badge count reflects the number of unread messages upon opening the app
- Badge count decreases/clears immediately after messages are read
- Badge count does not remain stale or incorrect

## Postconditions
- Unread badge count equals 0 after all messages are read
