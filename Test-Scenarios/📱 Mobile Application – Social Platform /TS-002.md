# TS-002 – Real-time message delivery state and synchronization

This scenario validates real-time messaging synchronization between sender and receiver.

It focuses on:
- Delivery status accuracy (Sending, Sent, Delivered, Seen if supported)
- Correct updates after receiver gets the message
- No indefinite pending states
- Consistency across different devices and OS versions
