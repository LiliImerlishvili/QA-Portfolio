# BUG-002 – Message status remains "Sending" after successful delivery

**Bug ID:** BUG-002  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Severity:** Major  
**Status:** Open  

## Description
After sending a message, the delivery status stays at "Sending" even though the receiver gets the message. This causes confusion and duplicate resend attempts.

## Preconditions
- User A and User B are logged in on separate devices/emulators
- Chat between User A and User B exists
- Both users have stable internet connection

## Steps to Reproduce
1. From User A, open chat with User B
2. Send a short text message
3. Observe message status under the sent message
4. On User B device, confirm the message is received

## Actual Result
User B receives the message, but on User A side the status stays on "Sending" indefinitely.

## Expected Result
Status should update from "Sending" to "Sent/Delivered" (and to "Seen" if supported) within a reasonable time.

## Environment
- Device A: Android Emulator (Pixel 6), Android 13
- Device B: Android Emulator (Pixel 5), Android 12
- App Build: Staging
- Network: Wi-Fi
