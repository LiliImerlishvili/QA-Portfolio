# # 🧩 Test Cases (Based on Real Bug Reports)

This folder contains detailed, NDA-safe test cases designed directly from discovered defects in the e-commerce project.

Each test case:

- Is **linked to a specific Bug ID** from the Bug Reports folder  
- Follows a **full ISTQB-style structure** (Purpose, Preconditions, Steps, Expected Result)  
- Demonstrates **positive and negative coverage** for critical flows  
- Shows clear **traceability** between Test Cases and Bug Reports

## 🎯 Purpose

These test cases were created to:

- Validate **core e-commerce flows** (navigation, brands, product details, registration, recommendations)  
- Ensure that **reported bugs are reproducible using well-defined steps**  
- Provide **regression coverage** for fixed defects  
- Maintain **clear traceability** between requirements → test cases → bug reports
