🔗 RTM – Requirements Traceability Matrix

This folder contains a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) that links business requirements to related test scenarios, test cases and bug reports.

The RTM provides a clear and structured view of:
• Which requirements are covered by testing  
• Which test cases validate each scenario  
• Which defects were identified during execution  
• Overall test coverage and potential risk areas  

🎯 Purpose
The Traceability Matrix is used to:
• Ensure full coverage of business and functional requirements  
• Maintain clear traceability between Requirements → Scenarios → Test Cases → Bug Reports  
• Identify untested or high-risk areas early  
• Improve transparency during sprint planning and test execution  
• Demonstrate a systematic, requirement-driven testing approach  

🛠 Tools Used
• Jira – Linking user stories and defects  
• Qase / TestRail – Managing test cases and scenarios  
• Google Sheets / Markdown – RTM documentation and mapping  
• GitHub – Organizing RTM alongside related QA artifacts  

🧾 Summary
The RTM demonstrates that testing was performed in a structured and traceable way, rather than ad-hoc execution.

Each entry follows the flow:
Requirement → Scenario → Test Case → Bug Report

This approach is widely used in professional QA environments and helps stakeholders quickly assess test coverage and quality status.
