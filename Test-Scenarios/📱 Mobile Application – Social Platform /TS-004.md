# TS-004 – Unread badge count accuracy across app states

This scenario validates unread indicators and badge count logic across user journeys.

It focuses on:
- Badge count accuracy after receiving new messages
- Immediate badge updates after reading messages
- Correct behavior when switching between chats
- Consistency between app icon badge and in-app counters (if both exist)
