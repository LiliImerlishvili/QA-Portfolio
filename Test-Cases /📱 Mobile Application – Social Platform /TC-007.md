# TC-007 – Validate API status code and error handling for failed media upload

**Test Case ID:** TC-007  
**Related Bug:** BUG-007  
**Test Type:** API  
**Priority:** High  

## Objective
Verify that the API returns an appropriate error status code (4xx) when media upload fails and UI reflects the failure.

## Preconditions
- User is logged in
- Postman or Network Inspector is available
- Media upload request can be observed
- An invalid or unsupported file is available for upload test

## Test Steps
1. Attempt to upload an unsupported file type (example: .tiff) using the app or Postman
2. Capture the upload API response
3. Verify HTTP status code and response payload
4. Observe UI behavior in the app after upload attempt

## Expected Result
- API returns a proper error status code (4xx) for failed validation
- Response includes an error message
- App displays a clear upload failure message with retry option
- App does not show false success state

## Postconditions
- Upload is not marked as successful and user can retry or cancel
