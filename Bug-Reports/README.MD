The goal of this collection is to showcase:
	•	Proficiency in functional, UI/UX, responsive, and cross-browser testing
	•	Strong bug reporting skills using Jira / Qase standards
	•	Clear separation of severity, reproducibility, and environment
	•	Ability to analyze design mismatches (Figma vs Implementation)
	•	Capability to test mobile and desktop platforms
