# TS-006 – Permission handling for camera and media access

This scenario validates app stability and UX when permissions are denied or restricted.

It focuses on:
- No crashes when permissions are denied
- Clear permission guidance and recovery path to Settings
- Correct fallback options (gallery instead of camera if applicable)
- Consistent permission prompts across OS versions
